Hi visitor! I'm Stefano and am PhD Student at Milano University. My central research topic is based on the CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) radiation observation. Actually, the CMB observation is not a specific area, but concern very different fields.
<br>
Around the concept of the CMB observation we can find different people that operating in different field (i.e. mechanical manufactures of the telescope components, theoretical studies of the scanning strategy, theoretical and experimental modelization of the systematic errors), and they makes the CMB observation possible.
<br>
I have worked in sperimental CMB group of Milan since April 2018, and recently, I have been start studing the atmospheric influence in the ground-based CMB observations. I have focused my attenctions on the case of STRIP (The low frequency conterpart of the whole CMB experiment LSPE, devoted to observe the CMB polarization on large angular scales). The STRIP telescope will be deploy in late 2020 at Observatorio del Teide - Tenerife.

For the atmospheric forecast I use C++, python3 and recently I have been start exploring the Julia language. If you have time, you will find in this website several snippets, examples and personal opinions about this new programming language.
